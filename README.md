# Virtually Controlled Mouse with Python and OpenCV  

## Overview  
This project is a **virtually controlled mouse** implemented using Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI. It uses hand tracking and gesture recognition to control mouse movements and actions, enabling users to interact with their computer without physical contact with the mouse.  

## Features  
- **Hand Tracking**: Detect and track hand landmarks in real-time using Mediapipe.  
- **Cursor Control**: Move the mouse cursor based on hand movement.  
- **Click Actions**: Perform left-click, right-click, and double-click using specific gestures.  
- **Drag and Drop**: Enable drag-and-drop functionality with hand gestures.  
- **Scroll**: Scroll up and down by making specific gestures.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Programming language for development.  
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video capture and image processing.  
- **Mediapipe**: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.  
- **PyAutoGUI**: For simulating mouse actions.
